/**
 *   The concept of a Functor.
 *   A functor is something that applies a simple function, A ⇒ B, to some F[A] to yield an F[B].
 *   You will know this as the map method on collection types. Sometimes,
 *   you will see map called fmap.
 *
 *  There are a couple of laws associated with a Functor, F:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>F map identity == F</li>
 *  <li>Given two functions, g and h, F map (g andThen h) == (F map g) map h</li>
 *  </ul>
